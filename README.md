# Object_Oriented_Programming
My notes on OOP. So i'm in a coding class, so some may be notes.
i am not an adult, but i'm allowed to do this.
i like turtle. I use Visual Studio Code. Sometimes i end up making lots of typos.
that's what happens when you use google slides too much and get pens to admire them and mostly not use them.
